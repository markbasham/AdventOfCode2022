Christmas takes tinsel
the silence is gone
while the bells ain't empty
if the bells ain't silent
burn the bells
let the silence be with the bells

listen to the bells

listen to the bells
give the silence back

the snow is everything
listen to the bells
while the bells ain't empty
let joy be Christmas taking the snow
if joy is stronger than the snow
put joy into the snow


whisper the snow
